keeping one off utility scripts separate from react code

Prevents React build (npm run build) from bundling unnecessary Node-only code.

Common convention: scripts/ or tools/ for preprocessing, migrations, and data generation.


(documented running npm init -y then npm install turf)
(in project root, run node scripts/generateCentroids.js - generated countryCentroids.json)
